=====
License: MIT
Features:
* Set delayed notification
* Set delayed repeatable notification
* Supports custom icon and large icon
* Fully supports Android 5.0

If you get obsolete warning like "*OBSOLETE - Providing Android resources in Assets/Plugins/Android/res is deprecated, please move your resources to an Android Library. See "Building Plugins for Android" section of the Manual.*", you can avoid this by recompiling plugin with icons inside.
